/// A struct implementing a simple HTTP/2 client.
///
/// This client works as an HTTP/1.1 client with a Keep-Alive connection and
/// pipelining might work.
///
/// Multiple requests can be queued up (and sent to the server) by calling
/// `request` multiple times, before any `get_response`.
///
/// Once a `get_response` is issued, the client blocks until it receives the
/// response for the particular request that was referenced in the `get_response`
/// call.
///
/// Therefore, by doing `request` -> `get_response` we can use the HTTP/2
/// connection as a `Keep-Alive` HTTP/1.1 connection and a pipelined flow by
/// queuing up a sequence of requests and then "joining" over them by calling
/// `get_response` for each of them.
///
/// The responses that are returned by the client are very raw representations
/// of the response.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Issue a simple GET request using the helper `get` method. Premade connection
/// passed to the client.

/// // They are returned as raw bytes for the user to do as they please.
